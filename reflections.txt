You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
- I learned that I should re-read directions.
- I learned the structuring of HTML is unique and definitely requires practice
-I also learned that <h1>-<h6> is a size reference

-text such as italics or bold were easy. although I used <strong>, maybe <b>
was a better choice
-Syntax for HTML is not very complicated

-learning to space paragraphs, heading and spans. I have a strong feeling
that I "over-coded" this project quite a bit
-Structuring of HTML

-This is my first project if I'm not mistaken. However my problem solving
strategies teeter on a balance of taking breaks to absorb the information
and the getting back at it and hammering away. It takes time to read through
MDN Documentation, test it out and properly implement it. Although HTML is
nice in that its complexity is not overwhelming, It still going to take some
time to become proficient or perhaps "fluent".
